# Contact Book

Contact Book is a simple web application built with Angular that allows users to manage their contacts easily. This project is designed to demonstrate a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation using Angular as the front-end framework and CosmosDB with Azure functions for the back-end.

This is just a live demo, there is no back end, data resets on page reload.
